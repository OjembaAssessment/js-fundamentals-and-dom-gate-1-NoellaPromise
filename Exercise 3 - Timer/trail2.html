const paragraph = The European languages are members of the same family. Their
separate existence is a myth. For science, music, sport, etc, Europe uses the
same vocabulary. The languages only differ in their grammar, their pronunciation
and their most common words. Everyone realizes why a new common language would
be desirable: one could refuse to pay expensive translators. To achieve this, it
would be necessary to have uniform grammar, pronunciation and more common words.
If several languages coalesce, the grammar of the resulting language is more
simple and regular than that of the individual languages. The new common
language will be more simple and regular than the existing European languages.
It will be as simple as Occidental; in fact, it will be Occidental. To an
English person, it will seem like simplified English, as a skeptical Cambridge
friend of mine told me what Occidental is. The European languages are members of
